# ChannelSorter-OSX
Hack to re-order a XML artifact as provided by our LG TV. Made out of frustration because channel ordering on our 2LF652V-ZA really sucks!
Currently just cares about the DTV node as we're on cable. 

It's a filthy hack, use with caution. If you need a sophisticated solution, point your browser to [ChanSort](https://github.com/PredatH0r/ChanSort).
